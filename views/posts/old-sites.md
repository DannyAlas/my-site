# My old sites

They're still live if you wanna explore them.

I moved to this simple site cause sometimes less is more :)

## [Old 1](https://old1.danielalas.com)
- [Github Repo](https://github.com/DannyAlas/my-site)
- Built using NextJS, threeJS, hosted on Vercel, and based off of the tutorials from [devaslife](https://www.youtube.com/@devaslife/featured)
- I added [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev/) for CMS and some custom UI stuff

## [Old2](https://osld2.danielalas.com)
- A Webflow based site as an attempt to learn the platform. (not for me)
